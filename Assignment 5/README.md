C1_w2_linear_Regression

In this assignment, I utilized linear regression to process our data, employing it to implement linear regression with one variable aimed at predicting profits for a restaurant franchise. The dataset includes information on cities considered as potential locations for a new restaurant. Specifically, x_train represents the population of a city, while y_train represents the corresponding profit of a restaurant in that city. It's noteworthy that a negative value for profit indicates a loss. As you may recall from our lectures, for one variable, the cost function for linear regression, denoted as 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏), is defined.

Following the definition of the cost function, I proceeded to implement the gradient for parameters 𝑤 and 𝑏 for linear regression. Subsequently, I endeavored to determine the optimal parameters of a linear regression model by employing batch gradient descent. It's important to recall that "batch" in this context refers to processing all the examples in one iteration.
